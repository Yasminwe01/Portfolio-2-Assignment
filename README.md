This assignment was done on both WSL, windows subsystems for Linux, and tested on the 
intel1 server provided by the university. The Zabbix version used is version 6.0, and it is the 
same version throughout the whole assignment. In the first section, we implemented a dockercompose stack, defined a docker bridge network, as well as volume mount and configuration 
of the docker containers. In the second section, we implemented and used the Zabbix 
monitoring tool. We configured a Zabbix Proxy and a Zabbix Agent in each virtual machine
and configured a connection between the Zabbix Server to the proxy and agent. In the third 
section, we installed, configured, and started a web server that was connected to localhost and 
redirected the Zabbix-server frontend. The fourth section included the Zabbix frontend, basic 
host adding, psk encryption usage, and templates with items and triggers
